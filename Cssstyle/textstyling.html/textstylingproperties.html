        <h1>Typography Save the earth</h1>
        <div class="text1">The Earth is our home, and it provides everything we need to live—clean air, fresh water, fertile soil, and a safe place to grow. But today, pollution, deforestation, and climate change are putting our planet at risk. If we ignore these problems, future generations may not have the same natural beauty and resources we enjoy now.</div>
        <div class="text2">Protecting the Earth starts with small actions that everyone can do. Simple habits like reducing plastic use, saving water, recycling waste, and planting trees can make a big difference. When millions of people take small steps, the overall impact becomes powerful and meaningful. Every choice we make matters.</div>
        <p class="p1">Saving the Earth is not just a responsibility; it is a promise to the future. By caring for nature, respecting wildlife, and using resources wisely, we create a cleaner, healthier, and more peaceful world.</p>
        <p class="p2">Together, we can protect our planet and ensure that it remains a beautiful home for all living beings.</p>
